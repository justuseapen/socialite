# Test Suite Project

## Feature Tests
1. User registers with email and password [âœ“]
2. User connects new account to buffer []
3. User adds buffer profiles to Socialite []

5. User adds twitter accounts to the list []
6. User selects tweets from the list []
7. User buffers tweets []
8. User reviews updates []

*Refactor the tests so that changes to copy don't break everything.*

## Unit Tests
1. User
2. Buffer Account
3. Buffer Profile
4. List
5. Twitter Account


* On buffering from list view:
	- for success: display tweet as green
	- for failure: display tweet as red
		- Show failure message

* If there are no recent tweets, pull all-time best tweets

	# If there are no tweets from the last two days
	# 	Pull all-time top tweets
	# 	You can pull up to 3200 tweets, 200 at a time per account
	# 	and rate limiting could (will) be an issue


* Handle images
	- Test: Buffer using entities.media[0].url
	- If it works. Use that.
	- If it doesn't, search for
		- Downloading image to aws bucket
		- use image url from aws

* Add multiple accounts to a list at one time

* Check for uniqueness of account within a given list

* On list view, pull all tweets for all accounts.
	* Filter based on inputs by user (quality, timeframe)
